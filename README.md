# Counter for Timer

- Just pass date to this url in **YYYY-MM-DD** format and it will show you the time left for that date.

```bash
https://bhumit070.github.io/seconds-calculator/?date=YYYY-MM-DD
```

- I don't know why I created this but it is there in my local and I think it would be useful for someone.
